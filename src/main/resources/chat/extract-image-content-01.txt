Extract all the text from this image in the original language. If there is no text, describe the image in detail.
MOST IMPORTANTLY: INCLUDE ANY DATES YOU CAN FIND! The next process step will have to use these dates to sort the file into the correct directory.
I cannot stress enough how important it is that you include ALL the dates for the next step to work correctly.
If you cannot find a specific date, try to find the closest thing in the text content that could be a date. THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!
End your response with a "Document date: YYYY-MM-DD" or "Document date: cannot find date, but here is the closest thing I found: XYZ", to ensure the next step can work correctly.
Try to identify the document title in the content and output it as such.
Also, include the document language and be faithful to the original text.
